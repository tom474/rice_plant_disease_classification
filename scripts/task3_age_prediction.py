    Predicts the age class (in days) of a paddy plant from an image using a trained classification model.

    This function loads a pre-trained Keras model, preprocesses the input image (including resizing
    and normalization), runs the model to predict the age class index, and maps it to the actual age
    in days using AGE_CLASSES. It returns both the predicted age and the model's confidence score.

    Args:
        model_path (str): Path to the trained age classification model (.keras or .h5).
        image_path (str): Path to the input image of the rice plant.
        width (int, optional): Width to resize the image to. Defaults to 128.
        height (int, optional): Height to resize the image to. Defaults to 128.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, float]: A tuple containing the predicted age (in days) and the confidence score (0.0â€“1.0).
